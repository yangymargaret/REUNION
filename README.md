REUNION: Transcription factor binding prediction
and regulatory association inference from single-cell
multi-omics data

REUNION is an integrative computational framework which utilizes the single cell multi-omics data as input to infer peak-transcription factor (TF)-gene triplet regulatory associations and predict genome-wide TF binding activities in the peaks with or without TF motifs detected. 
REUNION unites two functionally cooperative methods Unify and ReDiscover. 
Unify performs regulatory association estimation utilizing the single-cell multi-omics data.
ReDiscover takes the regulatory associations estimated by Unify as input to perform TF binding prediction. Unify and ReDiscover supports each other within one framework.
